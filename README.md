# FHE-DGHV
Parallel C++ Implementation of the Fully Homomorphic Batch DGHV scheme with compressed public key <br />

**Notes** <br />
This was made for the purpose of fun/learning/proof of concept, and should NOT be used for any secure application.<br />

Please feel free to use/modify code. Everything is open-source.

**Pre-Req**: <br />
GMP, The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library https://gmplib.org/ <br />

```
./configure --enable-cxx   //more complex options for specific processors/ISAs are available through the GMP manual
make
make check 
make install
```


CUDA GPU offloading is available, but not required. <br />
OpenMP parallelization is available, but not required. <br />

**Using Library** <br />
Keys can be created with preset parameters: <br />
```
Pk example_pk = Pk::make_key(int security_level);
```
Security levels toy, small, medium and large, are inputs 0-3, respectively. <br />
You can also set your own parameters with the Pk constructor: <br />
```
Pk example_pk = Pk(int lam, int rho, int eta, int gam, int Theta, int alpha, int tau, int l);
example_pk.assert_parameter_correctness();
```

Data can be encoded with the "Encoding" class:<br />
```
std::vector<int> data = {0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1 ...};
Encoding example_encoding = Encoding(Pk publicKey, std::vector<int> data);
```
All encoded data should be treated as a vector of l (seperate) bits.

Addition and multiplication have been overloaded. They are done bitwise. <br />

Negation (of each individual "slot") is available:<br />
```
example_encoding.neg();
```
As is selection (as a static method):<br />
```
Encoding example_selected = Encoding::selector(std::vector<int> s, Encoding a, Encoding b); //if s=1: a, else b
```

Recoding happens automatically after enough operations, but can also be done explicitly:<br />
```
example_encoding.recode();
```
